Transfer learning algorithms ( Crops and weeds classification is a system where 43 types of crops
and 47 types of weeds belongs to Indian variety images were
collected and performed feature extraction and different Machine learning classification
algorithms were applied and the model withÂ the highest accuracy is predicted )
